### About

This is a training project I decided to make while learning Python, image manipulation and numpy arrays.

For each image:

* Extracts the RGB values of each pixel and stores them in a numpy array.
* Averages each numpy array representation of the RGB values.
* Stores the resulting averaged RBG values of each image file in a new numPy array.
* Finally, it takes the average of the new array containing the averages of each image.
* And creates a new image with the resulting averaged numpy array.

This could be done with any groups of image.
I decided to use 250 flags around the world to see what every flags average colour would look like.

You can find the final averaged image "blend.png" in the repository.\
Also, out of curiosity, I created the averaged images of all the flags as well. Can be found in the repository.

The code is open to improvements and other creative uses.

Feel free to use it for your own entertainment, curiosity or commercial purposes.

Thank you, @cristiroma for providing the flag data on gitHub.

PixelMeaner is a simple script that takes the average of pixel RGB values.\
